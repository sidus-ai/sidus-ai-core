### Twitter (X) integration sample

Simple integration with twitter (X), which implements the connection to the
platform and the publication of a tweet. A tweet is generated by converting
a user's query using a language model.

### Dependencies

The default kernel does not contain the dependencies required for plugins, as it is lightweight.
For plugins to work, you need to install dependencies in your project yourself.

```requirements
requests==2.32.3
tweepy==4.15.0
```

Please use this commandline for install dependencies:

```commandline
pip install requests tweepy
```

### Environments

To set up and run the example, use the following environment variables. They are necessary for proper
connection to external suppliers/consumers.

```properties
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=xx-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
X_CLIENT_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
X_CLIENT_SECRET=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
X_API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
X_API_SECRET=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
X_BEARER_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
X_ACCESS_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```
